## TDD

* Test driven development is the gold-standard of testing
* It is the repetition the following cycle:
  1. Write a a test that defines a new function or improvement
  2. Run your test and see it fail
  3. Write the minimum amount of code to get the test to pass
  4. Run the test and hopefully it passes!
  5. Refactor code
* TDD can guide your develop into writing clean, concise code
* Helps you maintain focus and breaks the problem into bitesize, manageable tasks
* Leads to less bugs
